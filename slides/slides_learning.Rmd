# Learning Unknown Unknowns

# My route...

# Stackoverflow

# Show of hands

# Who's "borrowed" code from SO?

# Who's asked a question?

# Who's anwered a question?

## Answering stackoverflow questions

 * Regardless of your level, there are questions you can answer
 
  * Even just edit a badly worded question helps
 
 * SO usually takes a few(?) minutes - so closure
 
# What happens if someone gives a better answer?

## Who cares!

  * Just edit your answer to say XXX is better

## Aside

  * Never use code you don't understand
  
  * Read about the [Nissian dev](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/5/4/11593084/dont-get-busted-copying-code-from-stack-overflow)

# Others ways

## Use the source!

 * Watching the GitHub R source code mirror will allow you to monitor small changes that occur
 
    * https://github.com/wch/r-source/
    
  * Also, look at how base R functions are written, e.g. `NCOL`
  
## R-dev Mailing List

 * Really useful to see how R is built and the compromises it has to make
 
 * I recommend giving at least a 6 week observing period before asking/answering
